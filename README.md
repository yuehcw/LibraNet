# LibraNet - A Web Library Application

## Overview
LibraNet is a web-based application that emulates the functionalities of a traditional library, allowing users to manage books and authors. It provides a comprehensive platform for adding, updating, deleting, and viewing books and authors. The application is built using modern web technologies, ensuring a responsive and intuitive user experience.

## Project Structure
The application is organized into several key directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the application's architecture:

- **Server.js**: The main server file that initializes and runs the Express server.
- **models/**: Contains the data models for the application, defining the schema for books and authors.
- **public/**: Houses static assets like JavaScript files, fonts, and CSS stylesheets for the client-side.
- **views/**: EJS templates for generating dynamic HTML content based on server-side data.
- **routes/**: Defines the routes for the application, handling HTTP requests for different parts of the site.

## Functionalities & Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Users can create, read, update, and delete information about books and authors.
- **File Uploads**: Support for uploading book cover images or related documents.
- **Custom Styling**: Tailored CSS for a unique and engaging user interface.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive, providing a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: The runtime environment for executing JavaScript on the server.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js, used to build web applications and APIs.
- **EJS**: A templating language for generating HTML markup with plain JavaScript.
- **CSS**: For styling the application's interface.
- **MongoDB**: Used as the backend database for storing application data.

## Setup and Installation
(Note: Specific setup and installation instructions would depend on further details within each file, especially `Server.js` for starting the server and `package.json` for dependencies.)



## Conclusion
LibraNet represents a modern take on library management, integrating traditional library functions with the advantages of web technology for accessibility and ease of use.
